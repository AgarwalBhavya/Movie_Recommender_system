# Movie_Recommender_system
This project implements a movie recommender system that personalizes recommendations based on user preferences. It leverages techniques like collaborative filtering or content-based filtering (depending on your implementation) to analyze user movie ratings or movie attributes and suggest similar films.

Features:
Personalized Recommendations: Get a list of top 5 movies tailored to your taste based on your selection.
User-Friendly Interface: The system is designed for ease of use, allowing you to explore movie recommendations with minimal effort.
Scalability and Adaptability: This project can be extended to incorporate more movies and adjust recommendation algorithms for better accuracy.

How to Use:

1.Clone the Repository:git clone https://github.com/AgarwalBhavya/movie-recommender-system.git
2.Install Dependencies (if necessary):cd movie-recommender-system
                                    pip install -r requirements.txt
3.Run the Recommendation Engine: python app.py
4.Interact with the System:Follow the on-screen instructions to select a movie.
The system will generate and display the top 5 recommended movies for you.
